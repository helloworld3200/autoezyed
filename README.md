### WORK IN PROGRESS

This uses Selenium Webdriver to automatically record the answers from EZYED
and then automatically inputs them on the next try of the assesment.
It's just an automatic web scraper.

### Requirements
- \>= Python 3.9
- Selenium WebDriver
- Google Chrome

**Once the project is done**, you should just be able to just run the
python file as long as you've installed the requirements. Native binaries
may be supported in the future.
